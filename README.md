## About
Altough, this was a group project where I was in charge of the front-end, I eventually made this as a full-stack developer. The original goal was to provide a random restaurant from a preference form that the user would fill out using React on the front-end and Python on the back-end. Due to time constraints for the group project, we had to accomodate for the project. I took what our group had a step further my providing an algorithm that would randomly choose a cuisine from a list, making it closer to the original goal. All that is left is to feed the information to an API to give back a random restaurant. I did try to use the Yelp-Fusion API, however, due to some conflict with CORS I have yet to finish the goal. I would love to finish this project one day, however!

## Original Wireframe (had to redesign to accomodate for Python)

## Status: On hold (Need to find a suitable API that can provide restaurant information)
